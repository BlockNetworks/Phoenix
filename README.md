__Risen from the ashes of PocketMine-MP__

## About
Phoenix is a server software for Minecraft Pocket Edition forked from PocketMine-MP 1.6.

### Why does this project exist?
This project was founded in September 2016 in response to the apparent death of PocketMine. I expect everyone who reads this will know the story of @shoghicp's extended absence, the inactivity in PocketMine that followed, @shoghicp's determined ignorance of everything PocketMine-related...

The last commit to PocketMine-MP was on the 22nd of June, after which point the repository received no updates at all. Even @Intyre, the final pillar supporting PocketMine, had given up all hope, after putting all his efforts into contacting @shoghicp about a possible handover of rights. 0.15.4 and 0.15.9 were released, bringing protocol changes which prevented players joining PocketMine servers, and these changes were not catered for. The less-technically-minded people were forced to look elsewhere for a server software that would work for them, while loyalists simply edited PocketMine directly and clung to the hopes that someone would come back and fix everything.

On the 25th of July 2016, one PocketMine staff member (@iamadpond) reappeared, with words of resurrecting PocketMine and making it great again. He started a fire in the PocketMine community, gave people hope. When those words went nowhere, people's hopes were crushed. He started a fire, and then let it die. New members would ask: why can't I connect to my server? We were forced to tell people the horrible truth: _PocketMine is dead._ 

They would then ask: are there any alternatives that my plugins will work on? And it was at this point that I'd stop for a moment, unsure how to answer. Reason? The only PocketMine variants left that were viable were all "spoons", and very low quality at that. The rebel in me hated telling people to use Genisys. The rebel hated sitting around waiting for somebody else to save the day. The rebel also hated the fact that @iamadpond's plans had been left to die, taking PocketMine's last hope with it... and so Phoenix was born.

### What makes this project different from spoons like ImagicalMine, ClearSky, Genisys?
See that "forked from PocketMine/PocketMine-MP" at the top of the page?

Phoenix aims to be the continuation of PocketMine-MP. Maximum quality standards will be enforced to ensure that only the best is added to the project. Someday, Phoenix may be able to be merged into PocketMine itself if anyone ever comes back to the repository. With that in mind, Phoenix has to be the absolute best that it can be.
